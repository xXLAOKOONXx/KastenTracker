# Rough Concept

The app will be a web app that is accessable via the web.

All parts of the app are restricted through authentication and authorization.

The authorization destinguishes between administrators, group owners and standard users:

- administrators can configure server wide settings
- group owners can configure group settings
- standard users might configure group settings based on the group settings
